        <h2>Welcome to the SFinExile Archive!</h2>

      <p class="style1">San Francisco in Exile Live at JSC (SFinX) is a performance series which produced 50 shows between 2001 to 2006, showcasing San Francisco's 

        queer performing arts world as well as documenting our live  performances as 

        images and sound files on a web-based archive. </p>
      <p>The SF in Exile (SFinX) series was launch as a tool of an arts community with a vision. Our mission was to be an aggressively 
  
        inclusive project, led by the people who make the queer scene the most 
  
        vibrant: creative writers and producers who are genderqueers, young people, 
  
        people of color, working-class, and poor -- in other words, those most 
  
      easily at risk for exile. </p>
      <p>Many of our city's art spaces  were eclipsed and lost in the early 2000's dot-com invasion - and the subsequent abandonment- by  dot-coms and the greedy landlords who chased them, and in this ongoing recession our performance 

        halls were closing at a dizzying rate. It was in that climate that SFinX arose to try to provide an on-line access point to the city's queer spoken word scene. </p>
      <p>SFinX reasserted the city's queer arts culture with defiant live performances 
  
        at the <A HREF="http://www.jonsimsctr.org/" target="new"><font color="red">Jon Sims 
  
        Center</font></A>, and with web-based dissemination. We wanted to keep our city 
  
        accessible and also advance the careers of our artists and technicians. </p>
      <p>The series  has been put into retirement due to the uncertain future of the Jon Sims Center (our fiscal sponsor and main venue), as well as other vicissitudes of fate. </p>      
      <p>For an archive of past shows, see our <a href="events/index.html">Events Index</a>. We hope you came to see our last show, Oct. 7, 2006, &quot;Cake and Debauchery.&quot; If you missed it, the sound files and photos will hopefully be up soon.</p>
      <p>- SFinX coordinator Sara Moore, March 31, 2007 (the 6 year anniversary of our debut show). </p></td>
